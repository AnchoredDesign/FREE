        <h3>Welcome to Anchored Design's FREE repo.</h3>

<p>We've added this page to make it easier to snag all of our free content with one download.  This will include any images, themes and code snippets we've added to our repository.  To get individual files, you'll need to visit our github repo by clicking on the View on GitHub button to the left of this text.</p>

<p>For the tech savvy, after you have git installed, you can get the FREE branch using the command line below:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git clone git://github.com/AnchoredDesign/FREE.git
</code></pre>

<h3>Genesis Themes</h3>

<p>We don't do free often, but we've crafted some handsome Genesis child themes for you to use. Support for the themes are paid since it cost us time to address your issue, but we'll include some documentation in the future. Please check back often for updates as well. </p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Aimee is talented graphic design artist who also can't live on your happiness alone, but we do like seeing you happy and also provided some free images for you guys to enjoy. There are flavors of social media roll-overs and code snippets for you to just grab and use in your site.  Enjoy! </p>
